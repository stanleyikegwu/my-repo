    		The wind carried whispers through the tall grass, stirring memories buried long ago. A lone figure walked the narrow path, eyes fixed on the horizon where the sun bled into hues of amber and violet. Above, the glass sky shimmered—fractured reflections of a world that once was, now held together by threads of hope and forgotten stories. Each step forward echoed with the weight of choices made, but also the promise of what could still be. In the quiet between heartbeats, the future waited—breathing, watching, ready.
